# XGBoost_algorithm_Master_Thesis

This repository illustrates the code for my Master Thesis, which centers around the implementation of the XGBoost Algorithm for calculating housing prices.

The project incorporates the following algorithms:

- Webscraping 
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

The project aims to address the following question: How does the XGBoost algorithm perform as a hedonic housing price model compared to Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and what impact does it have on the efficiency and interpretation of the estimated housing price?

**Abstract:** This thesis aims to investigate the performance of the XGBoost algorithm as a hedonic housing price model in comparison to Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Housing prices in Greater Copenhagen from 2018 to 2022 are obtained by scraping in order to predict housing prices. Feature importance and partial dependence plots are used to analyze the variables with the most significant impact on the models. The thesis has found size, location, and time to be the most important factors in housing price estimation.
The study finds that XGBoost captures about 77% of the variance in housing prices, indicating that more information may be needed to fully understand the factors driving housing prices. Compared to Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, XGBoost outperforms both in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency with a mean square error at 0.90072 and a total time per tree af 0.04 seconds. A more accurate hedonic housing price model could benefit real estate agents, banks, and credit institutions by providing insights into the housing market and assisting in the decision-making process.
